# üöÄ Radxa X4 Developers Hub üöÄ

Welcome to the official repository for open-source and open-hardware development for the **Radxa X4 Single-Board Computer**. This project provides a collection of resources, learning materials, and examples to help you get the most out of your Radxa board.

## üåü What is this Project About?

This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive set of tools and examples for the Radxa X4, with a focus on a custom **Communications HAT**. Our goal is to create a community-driven resource for learning and building exciting projects with this powerful SBC.

Whether you are a student, a hobbyist, or a professional developer, you will find valuable resources here to kickstart your projects.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Open-Hardware Communications HAT**: A custom-designed HAT for the Radxa X4 with support for various communication protocols. The hardware design is available in the `Radxa_HAT_communications/hardware` directory.
-   **Software Examples**: A rich collection of software examples for different communication protocols, including:
    -   **CoAP**: Client and server demos.
    -   **Modbus**: TCP and RTU examples, including a web-based HMI.
    -   **MQTT**, **LoRa**, **CAN**: Placeholder directories for future examples.
    -   **OTA**: A tutorial on secure Over-the-Air updates.
-   **CAD Files**: A directory for 3D models of the HAT and other mechanical parts.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   **`Radxa_HAT_communications/`**: The main directory for the Communications HAT project.
    -   **`CAD/`**: Contains 3D models and mechanical designs.
    -   **`hardware/`**: The KiCad project for the HAT, including schematics and PCB layout.
    -   **`software/`**: Software examples for the communication protocols.
-   **`LICENSE`**: The license for this project.
-   **`README.md`**: This file.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need a Radxa X4 board.

### Hardware

If you want to build your own Communications HAT, you can use the KiCad files in the `Radxa_HAT_communications/hardware` directory. You will need to order the PCB and the components and assemble them.

### Software

The software examples are located in the `Radxa_HAT_communications/software` directory. Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to compile and run the examples.

Most of the C examples depend on the `libmodbus` library. You can install it on a Debian-based system with:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libmodbus-dev
```

The Python examples have their own dependencies, which are listed in their respective `README.md` files.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an idea for a new example, a bug fix, or an improvement to the hardware design, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
