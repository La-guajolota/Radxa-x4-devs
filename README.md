## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   A **Radxa X4** board.
-   Basic knowledge of Linux and command-line tools.

### Hardware Setup

To build your own Communications HAT, you can use the KiCad files located in `Radxa_HAT_communications/hardware`. You will need to source the components and manufacture the PCB.

### Software Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adrianSlpalafox/Radxa-x4-devs.git
    cd Radxa-x4-devs
    ```

2.  **Explore the examples**:
    Navigate to the `Radxa_HAT_communications/software` directory. Each protocol has its own folder with a detailed `README.md`.

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    -   For the **C examples**, you'll likely need `libmodbus`:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libmodbus-dev build-essential
        ```
    -   For the **Python examples**, check the `README.md` in the respective directory for `pip` install instructions.
