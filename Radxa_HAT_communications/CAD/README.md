# ðŸ”© CAD (Computer-Aided Design)

This directory is designated for the mechanical design files of the Radxa Communications HAT.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

Here you will find all the necessary files for the physical structure of the HAT, including:

-   **3D Models** (e.g., `.step`, `.stl`)
-   **Mechanical Drawings** (e.g., `.dxf`)

These files are essential for:
-   âœ… 3D printing custom enclosures.
-   âœ… Visualizing the HAT and its components.
-   âœ… Integrating the HAT into larger mechanical assemblies.

> Currently, this directory is a placeholder. Mechanical files will be added as the project progresses.
