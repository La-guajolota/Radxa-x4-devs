# Radxa HAT Communications

Welcome to the `Radxa_HAT_communications` directory! This is the heart of the project, containing all the files related to the communication HAT for the Radxa single-board computers.

## What's Inside?

This directory is organized into three main subfolders:

- **CAD**: Contains the 3D models and mechanical design files for the HAT.
- **hardware**: Includes the electronic design files, like schematics and PCB layouts.
- **software**: Provides example code and applications to test and use the HAT's communication features.

## Navigation

- To explore the 3D models, head over to the `CAD` directory.
- For the electronic schematics and PCB design, check out the `hardware` directory.
- To get started with the software examples, dive into the `software` directory.

Happy hacking!
