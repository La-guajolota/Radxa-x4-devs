    > Contains the 3D models and mechanical design files for the HAT. Perfect for 3D printing enclosures or visualizing the physical design.

-   ### 🛠️ `hardware/`
    > Includes the electronic design files, such as schematics and PCB layouts, created in KiCad.

-   ### 💻 `software/`
    > Provides a collection of software examples and applications to test, use, and build upon the HAT's communication features.
