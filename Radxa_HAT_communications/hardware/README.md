# Radxa Communications HAT

This repository contains the hardware design files for a communications HAT for Radxa Single-Board Computers (SBCs). This HAT expands the capabilities of the Radxa SBC by providing multiple communication interfaces, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including industrial automation, IoT, and robotics.

## Overview

The Radxa Communications HAT is a versatile expansion board that provides CAN, RS485, and LoRa communication interfaces. It is designed to be a "Hardware Attached on Top" (HAT) for Radxa SBCs with a 40-pin GPIO header. The board is powered by an external 12V supply and includes onboard voltage regulators to provide the necessary 5V and 3.3V for the components.

## Features

- **CAN Interface:** The HAT includes a CAN interface with a `TJA1051T-3` transceiver and an `MCP2515-xSO` CAN controller. The interface is accessible via a screw terminal.
- **RS485 Interface:** An RS485 interface with a `MAX3485` transceiver is available on a screw terminal.
- **LoRa Communication:** The board is equipped with an `SX1278` LoRa module, allowing for long-range wireless communication. An antenna connector is provided.
- **Power Supply:** The HAT is powered by a 12V external supply and has an onboard buck converter (`MP2307`) and linear regulators (`AMS1117-5.0` and `LD1117V33`) to provide stable 5V and 3.3V power to the HAT and the Radxa SBC.
- **40-Pin GPIO Connector:** The HAT connects to the Radxa SBC via a 40-pin GPIO connector.
