# ðŸ“¦ CoAP: Constrained Application Protocol

This directory contains a Python-based **CoAP server and client** for demonstrating communication with simulated IoT sensors.

---

## ðŸ“– About CoAP

> **CoAP** is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks in the Internet of Things. The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

-   **`demo_server.py`**: A CoAP server that simulates temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors.
-   **`demo_cliente.py`**: A command-line client to connect to the server, read sensor data, and monitor it in real-time.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Dependencies

To run these examples, you need to install the `aiocoap` library:

```bash
pip install aiocoap
```

### 2. How to Use

#### **Step 1: Start the Server**
Run the server on your Radxa board or any machine that will act as the sensor hub:

```bash
python3 demo_server.py
```
> The server will start and listen for connections on all network interfaces.

#### **Step 2: Run the Client**
On a separate machine, run the client to connect to the server:

```bash
python3 demo_cliente.py
```
> The client will attempt to automatically discover the server on the local network. If it fails, you can enter the server's IP address manually.

Once connected, you'll be presented with a menu to:
-   Read all sensors once.
-   Monitor the sensors continuously.
-   Change the server's IP address.

## ðŸ“¡ Server Endpoints

The server exposes the following CoAP endpoints:

| Endpoint                                | Description                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `.../info`                              | Get information about the server.            |
| `.../sensors/temperature`               | Get the current temperature reading.         |
| `.../sensors/humidity`                  | Get the current humidity reading.            |
| `.../sensors/pressure`                  | Get the current pressure reading.            |
| `.../sensors/all`                       | Get all sensor readings in a single request. |

You can also use a command-line tool like `coap-client` (if installed) to interact with the server:
```bash
coap-client -m get coap://<SERVER_IP>:5683/sensors/all
```
