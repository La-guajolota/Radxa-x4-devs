## ðŸ“– About LoRa

> **LoRa** is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) protocol developed by Semtech. It is based on spread spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology. It is ideal for wireless, battery-operated devices that need to send small amounts of data over long distances.
