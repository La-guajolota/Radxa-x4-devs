# Software for Radxa Communications HAT

Welcome to the software hub for the Radxa Communications HAT! ðŸš€

This directory contains a collection of software examples and tools to help you get started with the various communication protocols supported by the HAT.

## Communication Protocols

Each protocol has its own dedicated directory with specific examples:

- **Can**: Controller Area Network (CAN bus) examples.
- **CoAp**: Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for IoT devices.
- **LoRa**: Long Range communication examples.
- **Modbus**: Modbus protocol implementations.
- **MQTT**: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport examples.
- **OTA**: Over-the-Air update examples.

## Getting Started

To get started with a specific protocol, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file.

Each example is designed to be a starting point for your own projects. Feel free to modify and adapt the code to your needs.

Happy coding!
