## 📖 About MQTT

> **MQTT** is a lightweight, publish-subscribe, machine-to-machine network protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker, making it ideal for IoT and distributed systems.
